# UDACITY-Pneumonia_Detection
Pneumonia detection from chest x-rays. Project for the Udacity AI for Healthcare Nanodegree


In this project, you will apply the skills that you have acquired in this 2D medical imaging course to analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN
to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human 
radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device.
As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.
